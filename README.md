# ROOT-Colab
ROOT CERN in Colab
ROOT (https://root.cern/) is a toolkit developed at CERN. It is mainly used to perform data analysis in particle physics experiments.
This is an example of a pyROOT code used in Google Colab. It performs the Coincidence Time Resolution (CTR) analysis for Positron Emission Tomography (PET).
I compiled ROOT v6.26.4 source code specifically to be used in Google colab.
The notebook code automatically downloads the ROOT installation files from my DropBox repository to Google colab.
